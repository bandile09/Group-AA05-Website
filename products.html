<p><h4>Smart Cochlear Implant</h4>
    <br>
A cochlear implant is a complex electronic device that help provide a sense of sound to people who is deaf or hard of hearing. The implant consists of portion that sits behind the ear and a portion surgically placed under the skin. 
A microphone in a cochlear implant picks up sounds from the environment. a speech processor that chooses and organises microphone-captured sounds. The signals from the speech processor are then received by a transmitter, which converts them into electrical impulses. The electrode array is the only thing that makes it possible for the auditory nerve to receive impulses from a collection of electrodes that were collected from a stimulator. While providing users with a realistic representation of the surroundings, this method does not replace regular hearing. Additionally, a Bluetooth device can be linked to a cochlear implant. Users can stream calls, change linked devices' settings.
This device is targeted for individuals with any type of hearing disability.
